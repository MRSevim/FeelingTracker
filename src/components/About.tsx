        This website is a nice tool for users to track their day to day mood and
        see how it changes over time. I needed something to track my mood so I
        developed it. However, anyone can create an account and start tracking
        their mood. So feel free to do so and and let me know what you think!

        My name is Muhammed Ra≈üid Sevim and I am from Turkey. I developed the
        website myself and I developed it with Nextjs. This is not meant to be
        fully functional web app but is just a fun little project that some
        people might find useful. However, I am open to suggestions on how to
        make it nicer and might implement more stuff to the thing in the future.
        If you are curious about other things I built, check my portfolio{" "}
